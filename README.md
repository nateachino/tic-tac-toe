**Tic-Tac-Toe**
===============
Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe game! This project was developed as a way to demonstrate my understanding of JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The game allows two players to play Tic-Tac-Toe in the browser.

To view the game you can clone the repository and run it locally by opening the index.html file.

This Tic-Tac-Toe game is simple and straight-forward, it allows two players to take turns playing the game on a 3x3 grid. The game state is managed in JavaScript and the game board is rendered dynamically using JavaScript and HTML. The game has a simple design and uses CSS to style the elements.

When the game is over, a message will be displayed to indicate which player won or if the game ended in a draw. The game can be restarted by clicking on the reset button
